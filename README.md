# 🚀 LeetCode Solutions in Swift

This repository contains my solutions to various [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems, all implemented in **Swift**.
I’m using this repo to practice algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving while strengthening my Swift development skills.

---


* Each file includes the **problem statement**, my **solution in Swift**, and sometimes a **complexity analysis**.
* Solutions are tested using simple Swift Playground snippets or Xcode projects.

---

## 🛠 Topics Covered

* ✅ Arrays & Strings
* ✅ HashMaps & Dictionaries
* ✅ Stacks & Queues
* ✅ Linked Lists
* ✅ Trees & Graphs
* ✅ Dynamic Programming
* ✅ Sorting & Searching
* ✅ Concurrency & Other Swift Features

## 💡 Why Swift?

* Swift is my primary language for **iOS development**.
* Practicing algorithms in Swift sharpens both my **problem-solving** and **language fluency**.
* Swift’s safety features (`optionals`, `strong typing`, etc.) make it an interesting language for algorithmic challenges.
